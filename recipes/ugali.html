    <h2>What is Ugali?</h2>
    <p>
        If you are new to this to this food, you may be wondering what it is all about. I’ll try to help as much as I can. <br>

        Ugali is a staple in a lot of African countries, especially South Africa and East Africa.<br>

        It is a very ”thick porridge” made from finely ground white cornmeal popularly known as mealie meal.<br> It is similar to polenta but thicker in texture, and it is usually served as an accompaniment to meat and vegetable soups and stews.
